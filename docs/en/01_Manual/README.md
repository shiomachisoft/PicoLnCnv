## Overview

The microcontroller board uses Raspberry Pi Pico W.

PicoBrg is firmware that converts (bridges) communication in the following two modes.

### Communication Modes
- **BLE Mode**  
  BLE <-> UART conversion
- **Wi-Fi Mode**  
  Wi-Fi (TCP socket communication) <-> UART conversion

### System Configuration

PicoBrg consists of two phases: "Settings" via the PC app and actual "Bridge Communication".

#### 1. Configuration During Settings

Use the dedicated PC app to configure various settings for Pico W (Communication Mode, Wi-Fi, UART).

![Settings](images/Pictures/settings.png)

> **Note:**
> - Connect the PC and Pico W with a USB cable to configure the settings.
> - Various settings (Communication Mode, Wi-Fi, UART) are saved in the Flash memory inside Pico W, so they are retained even if the power is turned off after setting them once.

#### 2. Configuration During Bridge Communication

After the settings are completed, Pico W acts as a data bridge according to the configured communication mode.

![Bridge](images/Pictures/bridge.png)

> **Notes on Communication Modes:**
> - The default is BLE mode.
> - In BLE mode, Pico W operates as a BLE "Peripheral".
> - In Wi-Fi mode, Pico W can operate as either a "TCP Server" or a "TCP Client".

## Contents

### Firmware (FW)

- PicoBrg_`XXXXXXXX`.uf2  
  This is the firmware to write to Pico W (`XXXXXXXX` is the version date).

### PC App

- PicoJigApp Folder  
  Contains the binaries for the Windows app used to configure various settings (Communication Mode, Wi-Fi, UART).

## Setup

### Writing FW to Pico W

Below is the procedure for writing the FW to Pico W.

1. While pressing the white button (BOOTSEL button) on Pico W, connect Pico W to the PC with a USB cable.  
   The RPI-RP2 drive will then be recognized.

   ![Drive Recognition](images/Pictures/RPI_DRIVE.png)

2. Drag and drop `PicoBrg_XXXXXXXX.uf2` into the RPI-RP2 drive.

   ![File Drag](images/Pictures/RPI_DRAG.png)

This completes the firmware writing.

* When writing is complete, Pico W will automatically restart and the firmware will boot (from the next time, it will boot just by turning on the power).

### PC Setup

1. Copy the entire `PicoJigApp` folder to a suitable location on your PC (such as the desktop).
2. Check the version of the `.NET Framework`.  
   **In a Windows environment, `.NET Framework 4.6.2` or higher (4.x.x) must be enabled.**  
   It is not compatible with `.NET 5` or higher.
   
   > **Caution:**  
   > Enable the `.NET Framework` at your own risk.    
   > However, on Windows 11 and Windows 10 with the latest updates applied, `.NET Framework 4.8` is enabled by default, so you basically do not need to change the settings.
   
   You can check if `.NET Framework 4.8` is enabled on Windows by following the steps below.  
   Open **Control Panel** > **Programs** > **Turn Windows features on or off**.

   ![Turn Windows features on or off](images/Pictures/DotNet.png)

   => Ensure that the checkbox for `.NET Framework 4.8` is solid blue.

## LED

### LED Status

#### In BLE Mode

- If Pico W is not connected to a Central, the LED flashes at 500ms intervals.
- If Pico W is connected to a Central, the LED stops flashing and turns on solidly.

#### In Wi-Fi Mode

- If Pico W is not connected to a Wi-Fi router, the LED flashes at 500ms intervals.
- If Pico W is connected to a Wi-Fi router, the LED stops flashing and turns on solidly.

## Pins Used

### Pins Used for UART

The Pico W pins used for UART are as follows.

| Function | Pico W Pin |
| :--- | :--- |
| UART0 TX | GP0 (Pin 1) |
| UART0 RX | GP1 (Pin 2) |

## BLE UUIDs

The Nordic UART Service (NUS) is used for BLE communication.

- **Service UUID (GATT & Advertise)**  
  `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- **Characteristic UUID (Write: BLE -> UART)**  
  `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- **Characteristic UUID (Notify: UART -> BLE)**  
  `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`

## Default Settings

| Setting Item | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mode** | BLE Mode |
| **Baud Rate** | 9600bps |
| **Data Bits** | 8 |
| **Stop Bits** | 1 |
| **Parity** | None |

## Various Settings Using the PC App

### Starting PicoJigApp

#### Main Screen

#### Startup and Connection

1. Connect Pico W to the PC with a USB cable, wait for about 10 seconds, and then double-click `PicoJigApp.exe` in the `PicoJigApp` folder.  
   > **Note:**   
   > Waiting for about 10 seconds is because it takes time for Windows to recognize Pico W's virtual COM.  
   Double-clicking `PicoJigApp.exe` displays the main screen.
2. Leave the [USB Mode] radio button in [1] ON.
3. Select the Pico W COM number in [2] and press the [3] button.  
   If the display in [4] changes to `connected`, it is successfully connected to Pico W.

When the display in [4] changes to `connected`, the buttons in area [5] ([NW Config], [UART]) and button [6] become enabled.

You can change the UART settings by following the steps below.

1. Select the baud rate in [1].
2. Select the stop bit in [2].
3. Select the parity in [3].   
   * **The data bit is fixed at `8`.**
4. Press the button [4].  
   Pressing the button [4] configures the UART settings.

### Erasing Setting Data in Flash Memory

The following setting data is saved in Pico W's Flash memory.

- Communication Mode Settings
